# Compressive Strength Prediction of Concrete Using Machine Learning
------

This repository contains dataset, and the notebook used for building a machine learning model
that predicts the compressive strength of concrete from various input values.

This project seeks to build a model with high performance, by exploring
numerous algorithms including Artificial Neural Network(ANN).
